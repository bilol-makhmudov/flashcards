Learn 100 of the most used German words with flashcards. 

# description 

The program helps users to learn german words with flashcards. 

# functionalities 

It takes the random german words from the data.csv and shows them to the user. When a user clicks "Yes" the chosen word gets +2 points, when "Maybe" is clicked the word gets +1 points, and for "No" it doesn't get points. While choosing the word their points are taken into consideration and the program won't show the word with points higher than 10 points. The results are saved directly in the data.csv, so when the user exits the program data won't be lost. 

# libraries
